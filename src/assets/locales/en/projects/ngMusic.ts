        <li><strong>Design:</strong> The decision was made to develop a desktop-only application, and up to 3 different mockups were presented. The one shown in the images resulted from the final development exploration.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Angular:</strong> We chose Angular for its organized and easily understandable architecture for all team members.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Firebase:</strong> Due to its easy implementation and the fact that the database architecture in collections worked better than a relational database for this project.</li>
        
        <li><strong>Key Decision:</strong> Creating our own music playback library using the power of JavaScript. This decision was made after exploring several libraries, none of which adequately met our requirements.</li>

      I actively participated in this project, both as a developer and as the DevOps for the product. I was actively involved in every part of the project development, exploring and understanding how to distribute responsibilities among my colleagues to achieve small objectives that would integrate into a large application in the long run.<br><br>
      
      As the product leader, I ensured the satisfaction of my team by creating realistic deadlines without losing the ambition to deliver excellent work. This resulted in the best possible outcome: a perfect 10 out of 10 in the final grade, making us one of the most outstanding teams in the course.<br><br>
      
      Finally, none of this would have been possible without the support, participation, and trust of my colleagues. Dedicated to them.`
