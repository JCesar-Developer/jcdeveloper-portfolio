        I wanted to develop a portfolio that stood out, especially for the detailed exposure of my different projects, emphasizing the challenging design and development processes that characterize them.
        <br><br>
        The design of a project is an extensive process that requires making a series of important decisions related to the balance between a pleasant interface and the best possible user experience. And, far from ending with the product delivery; I discovered that it evolves throughout the project's development.
        <br><br>
        Thus, both design and development are iterative processes. Design sets the product path, and development modifies the design to adapt it to the software's needs and features. It is in this constant give-and-take of continuous growth that the magic of creating a digital product resides.
        <br><br>
        With this project, I learned that design is not a static product, and despite its challenging decision-making processes, a design looking good on paper or in Figma doesn't necessarily make it the best final product. It is also prone to change, evolution, and improvement. In summary, I am very satisfied to have carried out this project and to have learned so much from it.
